# CLRS Algorithms – 4th Edition

Welcome to my repository for studying and implementing algorithms from the classic textbook **"Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition"** by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein — commonly referred to as **CLRS**.

This project is a personal deep-dive into algorithmic theory and practical implementation. It includes solutions to selected exercises, implementations of key algorithms, and explanatory notes — all organized by chapter.

This project is **not intended to be perfect** or production-ready. It intentionally **does not include error handling**, input validation, or edge case coverage. As the focus is on **clarity and correctness of the core algorithmic concepts**, as presented in the textbook.  Code is written to be **clean, minimal, and easy to follow**, prioritizing learning over completeness.

## 📘 About the Book

> *Introduction to Algorithms* is one of the most widely used textbooks for learning algorithms and data structures, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced topics like dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.

This repo follows the structure and content of the **4th Edition** released in 2022, which includes updates to existing chapters and new material like:
- **Augmented data structures**
- **Multithreaded algorithms**
- **New problems and updated proofs**
